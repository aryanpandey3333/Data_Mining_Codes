# Data_Mining_Codes
This repository contains my lab files for the Data Mining projects. The files include source code, data sets, and output files that were created as part of my coursework.

Each lab file corresponds to a specific Data Mining concept or application, and includes a brief description of the project's purpose and functionality. The files are organized by lab session and cover a range of topics, including data preprocessing, clustering, classification, and association rule mining.

The lab files also include documentation that provides an overview of the Data Mining concepts used and the results obtained. This documentation can be used as a reference guide for anyone interested in Data Mining or for those who are looking to expand their knowledge and skills in this area.

Overall, these lab files provide a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about Data Mining. They are suitable for students, researchers, and professionals who are interested in exploring and applying Data Mining in their work. The lab files include the use of popular Data Mining tools and libraries such as Weka, RapidMiner, and Python scikit-learn.
